# Miami-Dade-App
This is a demo application for the sign in sheet


miamiDade.java is the main file
PageOne.java is the app section which simulates the user clicking on "apps"
timeSheet.java is the time sheet layout. I have left this un-decorated to promote creative ideas to make this look better. The current screen that you see is simply the skeleton of it. 

# Description

Every time an employee clicks the sign-in button, the process will automatically record the time and date. Keep in mind, this is simply a skeleton using the Miami-Dade County app as a reference. The number of times sign-ins are recorded is currently set to 5 times a day; however, that can be adjusted. 


# Pros 
Allows teachers to keep track of their sign-ins and make sure they are being paid fairly for what they are working for. No one wants to work and not get paid for it.

# Cons/Notices
The original app would require user to verify their identity after signing in. For account safety and privacy, the time sheet data will be recorded after the user has verified it. This app also does not account for when teachers are signing in on off days -- that will be a future update. Time sheet fraud and all other legal actions will have to be accounted for later for future updates. 

Administrators would have to pay extra attention, and if a teacher has not signed in, they would have to contact the administrator to resolve the issue.
